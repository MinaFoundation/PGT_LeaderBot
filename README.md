# LeaderBot
Tool that will track and rank contributions across the different Mina developer programs

## Tool functions
Contribution Tracking: Monitors contributions to selected repositories.

Leaderboard Updates: Ranks contributors based on predefined metrics (KPI): 10+ days of qualified commits within a month.

## Contributions

To make a contribution, follow these steps:

1. Make an issue that includes a user story for what the user should be able to do (e.g., the user should be able to view the survey summary in their local language).
2. Get that issue tested by: Cristina Echeverry.
3. Get that issue approved by the product owners: es92 or Cristina Echeverry.
4. Write a PR and get it approved by the code owners and Mina devops: Es92 (code owner), berkingurcan (developer & codeco-owner), johnmarcou (Mina devops). Each PR must correspond to an approved issue. By default, PRs should be merged by the PR submitter, though in some cases if changes are needed, they can be merged by code owners.
